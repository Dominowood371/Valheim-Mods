  // Iron Plate Helmet
  // An unusually shaped helmet, you've got a feeling your descendants will love it.
  // Iron Platemail
  // An armor fashioned from large plates of iron. Feels tiring to just look at it.
  // Iron Plate Leggings
  // Thick plates of metal, finally something to stop those pesky dwarves from gnawing at your legs.
