## - Cheat Commands -
To activate cheat commands, type devcommands and press enter. You'll be able to use the cheat commands below in singleplayer mode. They won't work on a multiplayer server.

To deactivate cheat commands, type devcommands and press enter again.

  **How to Read this List:**

- Anything between parentheses ( ) is a comment describing the command. (don't type these)
- Anything in brackets [ ] are arguments that the command takes. (don't add the brackets when using the commands)
- Not every command has arguments and sometimes not all arguments are required

**Examples:**
`wind [angle] [intensity 0-1]`
To use this in game you would replace [angle] and [intensity] with numbers.
`wind 45 0.5`
